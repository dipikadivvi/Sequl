For loop and While loop-- Iterate over the iterable object until the 
iterate on the sequence is for for loop
while is for block of code until the condition is satisfied.
Approach to learning the code is  write steps to what is the ask, what to do, how to do like a breakdown then proceed
Ex:add list of numbers form 1-10
1)Read the input
2)Take numbers one by one and add then... so we need a loop to iterate the data
3)create another variable which store the output and then keep on add
we have function called range()  ex: list(range(1,15,2))
so, it starts from 1 and go by step count of 2 until it reaches 15 
***index here always start from 0.
if you want to consider last index value also, then we must add range(x+)1
range will not include upper limit value. that is why we should use +1 always to be included

-- reverse string x=s(i)+1 chandler
c+'' = 'c'
h+'c' = 'hc'
a+'hc'='ahc'
it works like that.

when do we use length+1 and just length?
range(0,10)-->0-9 values
range(len(x)) this will give values until 9 only not 10. If you want to include 10 also then you should give like 
range(len(x)+1)

while loop keep continue until the condition is met. I want to loop until a condition is true and then exit from loop after that.
Q: Main difference between while and for loop.. when do we use them?
For-- When we know how many times it has to loop.
Iterates over a string,range,list
Automatically handle the iteration.

While -- when you don't know how many times it has to iterate
Runs as long as the condition is true
Must manually update the condition.

Break and Continue.
From a bunch of fruits, get what to you want and then break from loop, continue is continue and check how many are there but skip that ocuurance and print the output
