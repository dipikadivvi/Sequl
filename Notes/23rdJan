Quick Recap on select,where,like (%), Count, distinct, OrderBy,Limit,OR(Nor), Having, 

Diff between Having and where class
(Having works on Group and Where applies on all rows in a table)
Ex: 
How is wildcards different from Where clause
When we know what to search word 'data'then we apply %data%
data% then it start searching for words starting with data but can end with anything.

Built-in functions in sequl
#'strings'
select * from sakila.film;
Extra padding to the data.

Q: Where do we use this padding

select title 


#Substring is very important
select title, SUBSTRING(title, 3, 9) AS short_title
FROM Sakila.film;

#Concatination
When we want to add 2 string then we use CONCAT

#REVERSE(title)

#Length

#Substring with locate
Select email, SUBSTRING(email,LOCATE('@',email) +1) As Domain
from sakila.customer;

#Substring-index
Select Substring_index(email,'@',-1) from sakila.customer;

select email,
substring_index(SUBSTRING(email, LOCATE('@',email) +1), '.',-1) AS domain
FROM sakila.customer;

#UPPER,LOWER

#LEFT,RIGHT

If we put the aggregations then we must put them in  the groupby
SELECT Left(title,1) As First_letter, right(title,1) as Last_letter, title , COUNT(*) AS Film_Count
from sakila.film 
GROUP BY Left(title,2),right(title,3)
ORDER BY Film_Count DESC;


#CASE, IF,WHEN,ELSE
Select last_name
CASE
WHEN LEFT(last_name,1) BETWEEN 'A' AND 'M' THEN 'Group A_M'
WHEN LEFT(last_name,1) BETWEEN 'N' AND 'Z' THEN 'Group N_Z'
ELSE 'Other'
END AS group_label
from sakila.customer;

#REPLACE

#2 diff Where filters
hardcord names,with like some dynamic nature applies to where filter
How to acheive 100% dynamic nature to where clause
#REGEXP
cap is for not
where last_name REGEXP'[^aeiouAEIOU]{3}';

#end with vowel    $     where last_name REGEXP'[aeiouAEIOU]

#count

#Neumarical data
Math
#COUNT #SUM
Alter table sakila.film
select rental_duration from sakila.film
ADD Column cost_efficiency_dup1 DECIMAL(6,2);
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES =0;

UPDATE sakila.film
SET cost_efficiency_dup1= rental_duration *2
WHERE length is NOT NULL;


#Floor, #Random
#Ceil #Floor

0.99 Ceil -- 1 , Floor --0
2.90 ceil --3, Floor --2
#MOD is a percentail operater so it gives reminder value
#Round
#Month, monthname

#NOW, #MAX #CURDATE #CURRENT_TIME

#CASTING: Try to change the datatype of the columns
Decimal to Int or Int to String etc
Try and see if that works. Finish 1st assignment and Monday we will get a new assignament on functions
Monday: SubQueries, Joins,Views,Stored Procedures
