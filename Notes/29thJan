JOINS
cartetion product or cross join,self join,left join,

Full outer join and cross join difference
Normalisations, why do we use them
1-->Only one record per column.
2--> No partial dependency on Primary Key
3)--> No Transative dependency
To Optimize, space, cost, ,time,competence,uniqueness,fecting time we use normalisation

ON 1=0 is false condition, which will never be true
You want condition to fail but fetch all the data and matching data on both tables
If no relation ship then we make bridge table and join tables.
