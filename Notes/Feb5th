SQL works on DAtabases or structed data to query
Otherthan querying we use languages like python/java etc. Python is more simple and less code

Datatypes in Python--- Integer,
a=1
explicit conversion add str to convert to string
Implicit conversion
Floats
type--- give the type of the value
string \' then it works... like using backslash or escape characters
how to use both single and double quoets in a statement
naming convesion of variables.
1)Not start with special characters or numbers
2)no builin function keywords like 'int'
Complex numbers and Real numbers(what scenarios we use complex numbers?  real mathematical data.
j-1.0-2.0j
j
type(j)
Dynamic Typing.
ten=10
ten='ten'
automatically understand int or string
Mathematical,comparision and Logical operations, assignment operations,
1)+,-,*,/,//,%,**
2)==,!=,<,>,<=,>=
3)x=TRUE
y=FALSE
print(x and y)
print (x or y)
4)x=5
x=+5
x=-5
x +=5   x=x+5
x -=5    x=x-5
x *=3     x=x*3
--- Input functions(giving input by the user)
name= input("enter your name")
normal strin and f string differences. when you want to print something and take variables in to print then we use it
print("I love {},my subject is {}".format(language,subject))
difference between = and ==
= is assigning and == is for comparision
Branching(if/elif/else), case
print(x)

Does == check both type and variable?? YES
1 == '1'
FALSE
1 == 1
TRUE
