#Recap of previous class.
CAST works from int to string but not from string to integer
Try some built-in functions
Normalisation--- 
subquery,join,Corelated sub-queries
where do we use sub-queries and Joins in specific
#Disadvantages with sub-queries.
If w use count then we should have GroupBY
247-- returning different values by sub query. So we should limit 1 to make sure only 1 number comes as output to map with output. This is where we need joins
co-related sub-query outside of the query, the output is gone. Because it is not physically creating the table or data
complexcity, re-usability,query execution time is more
CTE-commmon table expression
JOINS--cardinality relationships 1:1,1:Many,Many:1,Many:Many
1:1 One record of my first table matches with 1 record of my second table username:status(Active/Inactive)
1:Many unique orderID but USER ID many be multiple
Many:1 Many orders placed by 1 customer
many:many friendship  many persons have many friends. This can be achieved by using bridge table. A table going to be join by the same table.userid with friendid
Buil-in functions assignment
order of execution in subquery
subquery in select statement or in the where clause... it depends on the position of where you write a subquery.
